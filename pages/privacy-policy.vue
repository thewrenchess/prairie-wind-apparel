              It's important to provide your users with an explanation of your
              privacy policy in order to comply with data privacy laws such as
              <a
                href="https://gdpr.eu/"
                target="_blank"

                >GDPR</a

              command of the cookies delivered by your site, and to communicate
              to your users:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>the purpose and scope of cookies on your site</li>
              <li>how and why information about your users is collected</li>
              <li>what kind of information about your users is collected</li>
              <li>when information about your users is collected</li>
              <li>how information about your users is used</li>
              <li>for how long information about your users is stored</li>
              <li>
                how to opt out of personal data collection, in part or in full
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Your obligations to disclose information about personal data
              collection will vary depending on where you do business. Please
              note that the data privacy communication obligations listed above
              are only provided as suggestions of industry best practices. While
              these reccomendations are a good starting point, it is the
              merchant's responsibility to seek out and act on the legal advice
              of an attorney before collecting or processing users' personal
              information.

              Enabling users to select their cookie preferences is an important
              component of GDPR compliance. You can use Nacelle's built-in
